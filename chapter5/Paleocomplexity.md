- importance of computational complexity: the different eras 
- paleocomplexity: era before P, NP
- decision procedure for computable problems
- if all real number proceedings (variables), then no space for godel statements
- deciding truth of a sentence with n symbols, it grows like 2^2^2... (n times)
- Tarskiâ€™s algorithm for deciding statements about the real numbers
- complexity: imposing upper bounds on memory time and 500 other things
- "how much can be computed in 20 million steps" - computer architecture
- TIME(F(n)) SPACE(F(n)) "solvable" by a "reference" ideal machine (turing computer)
- t contained in s because turing machine can access atmost 1 memory location per step.
- time hierarchy theorem: n^2 strictly contained in n^3
- proof: cant be computed in n^2 is proved by contradiction (same as HP proof)
- can't substitute this result for any f,g because time-constructability 
- 1970s weird arbitrary problems that weren't time-constructable
- can we multiply 2x2 matrices in n^2 time?
- Blum Speedup Theorem and theorem: for every problem P, can be solved in f(n) and log(f(n)) time
- soln to puzzles: yes self-printing codes need to be written in 3 parts
- mind-body problem, scientific description could be enough but needs the empirical feeling of it being water.
